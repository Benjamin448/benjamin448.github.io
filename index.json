[{"content":"On the surface, it may appear that Scratch is simply a program for kids to learn the basics of coding. But under the surface, Scratch is a programming language that teaches anyone skills that are used both inside and outside of the programming world.\nProblem Solving Scratch is a great tool for learning problem solving skills. When you use Scratch, you are confronted with many \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo;, or challenges: how do I make Scratch Cat move when I press the arrow keys? How do I add acceleration to the movement? How can I prevent Scratch Cat from moving across the room\u0026rsquo;s walls?\nThere are also layers of challenges within each task. What is the most efficient way to complete the task? (Scratch has a file size limit of 5 MB for online projects!) Will the way I implement it affect or be affected by any other scripts?\nAlso, don\u0026rsquo;t forget about bugs, or problems in the code! Fixing bugs is a critical part of problem solving in coding.\nRestricted Creativity Have you ever heard how creativity thrives in constraints? Well, Scratch is the perfect example of this.\nScratch consists of 125+ blocks, each providing a basic function, such as switching the sprite\u0026rsquo;s costume or getting the current direction of the sprite. If you want your project to have gravity, scenes, or many other features, you will have to make those on your own.\nBut does this mean that Scratch is limited in what it can do? Absolutely not!\nScratch has endless potential. For example, Scratch is a 2D engine, but tons of 3D projects are made, and it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon (but always astonishing) to see someone recreate a game such as Minecraft on Scratch.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not just 3D projects. You can make feature-packed platformers, a cloud server with Python, and captivating animations, all in one program.\nExpress Your Ideas in Code Many know that Scratch teaches you the basics of coding, but one of its hidden gems is that Scratch teaches you how to expresses your ideas in code. Scratch is the perfect environment for this: instead of having to type out your code, where spelling mistakes can be numerous, Scratch provides you with all the blocks you need.\nScratch\u0026rsquo;s simple blocks are also gateways into some of the more complex concepts of coding: clones lead into OOP and inheritance, and the \u0026ldquo;Run without screen refresh\u0026rdquo; option of custom blocks brings up the concept of frames and graphics.\nConclusion It has been about 9 years since I first used Scratch, and every time I come back to it, I learn concepts that I can then apply to other programming languages. Not only that, but Scratch provides me with problem-solving challenges in coding, and I have enjoyed every one of them.\nThe question now is, what will you make with Scratch?\nIf you are still hesitant about Scratch, I highly recommend you check out this article by Steve Krouse. It puts Scratch into words that I cannot.\n","permalink":"https://benjamin448.github.io/thoughts/learn-scratch-reasons/","summary":"On the surface, it may appear that Scratch is simply a program for kids to learn the basics of coding.

Scratch\u0026rsquo;s costume editor is filled with shortcuts! One of the best costume editor shortcuts is Alt-click.\nAlt-click is quite simple: it duplicates whatever shapes you click on in the costume editor.\nHowever, it is very likely you already use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste, or the copy and paste buttons in the costume editor toolbar. So, what makes Alt-Click different?\nIf you Alt-drag, you can quickly move the duplicated shapes to a new location. Alt-click always keeps the shapes in the same position as the original one. This is a game changer, since other copy-paste methods, including Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V, will always shift the shapes\u0026rsquo; position. This can be useful for aligning two shapes, e.g. Alt-clicking and then using the arrow keys. Alt-click is one of the most powerful Scratch shortcuts, and it can save you tons of time in the Scratch editor.\n","permalink":"https://benjamin448.github.io/tips/alt-click-costume-editor/","summary":"Alt-click simply duplicates whatever you click on, but it has some features copy-paste doesn\u0026rsquo;t have.","title":"Alt-Click: The Most Helpful Costume Editor Shortcut in Scratch"}]
